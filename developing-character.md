# Introducing and Developing a Character

**Start out with a clear idea of who the character is at the beginning of the story.**

* What does he/she care about?

* What does he/she believe?

* How does he/she behave in certain situations?

* What does he/she want more than anything else?

**Open with the character beginning from a place of imperfection or incompleteness.**

**Give the reader concrete examples throughout the book, but particularly early on, of the behaviuor and beliefs the character needs to change.**

**Give the character the tools he/she needs to improve himself.**

* Mentorship.

**Save the moment of revelation so it coincides with the emotional and physical climax.**

* If possible, bring the climaxes of the inner and outer journeys together.

**Prove the character's inner changes through his actions.**
